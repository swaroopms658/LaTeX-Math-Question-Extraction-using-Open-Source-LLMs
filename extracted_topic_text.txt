In section 30.3, we have introduced the concept of conditional probability which has been used
in multiplication theorem of probability. In this section, we will obtain a formula for finding the
conditional probability.
If A and B are two events associated with a random experiment, then
P(AnB)=P(A)P(B/A),ifP(A)7^0
P(AnB) = P(B)P(A/6), iiP{B)^0
P (A n B)

P{A/B) =

PROPERTIES OF CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY
Following are some properties of conditional probability which are stated and proved as
theorems.
P(B)
THEOREM 1
Let A and B be two events associated luith sample space S, then 0 < P (A/B) < 1.
PROOF
We know that
A n B c B => P (A n B) < P (B) => P (A n B)
[V P(B)>0]
<1, ifP(B)^0
P(B)
P(AnB)
Also,
P (A n B) > 0 and P (B) > 0. Therefore,
>0
P(B)
P (A n B)
Thus, we obtain:
0
<
<1
or, 0 <P (A/B) <l.Hence,0 <P (A/B) <1
P(B)

P{S/A)=P{A/A)=1

Let A and 6 be two events associated with a random experiment and S be the sample space.
If C is an event such that P (C) * 0, then
p({A u B)/C 1 = P (A/C) + P (B/C) - P {(A n B)/C)

EXAMPLE 1
If A and B are two events such that P(A) = 05, P (B) = 0.6 and P (A u B) = 0.8, find
P(A/B) andP{B/A).
SOLUTION
We have, P (A) = 05, P (B) = 0.6 and P (A u B) = 0.8
We know that
P (A u B) ^ P (A)+ P{B)-P {An B)
P(AnB) = P (A) + P (B) - P (A u B) = 05 + 0.6 - 0.8 = 0.3

Three distinguishable balls are distributed in three cells. Find the conditional probabilih/

SOLUTION
Since each ball can be placed in a cell in three ways. Therefore, three distinct balls
can be placed in three cells in 3 x 3 x 3 = 27 ways.
Consider the following events:
£ = All balls are in the same cell, F = At least two balls are in the same cell.

All balls can be placed in the same cell in three ways.
